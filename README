Rubidium 1.0.0 Beta 2
Coded by Alex Kau

Rubidium is a simple, easy-to-use content management system designed for
people with little or no previous website management experience.

Release notes:

-1.0.0 Beta 2:
	-The visual style is mostly complete.
	-Modules can now be added, edited and removed.
	-All settings are editable in the admin CP.
	-A contact form module has been added.
	-An installation script has been added.

-1.0.0 Beta 1:
	-The current visual style is extremely minimal and will be
	 significantly improved in later releases.
	-There is only basic functionality at the moment: Pages can be added,
	 edited and deleted, the index and 404 pages can be changed, and the
	 admin password can be changed.
	-There is no install script, so the variables in the config file have
	 to be set manually and db_schema.sql must be imported manually.
	-The default administrator password is 'test'. The admin CP can be
	 accessed at index.php?mode=admin.
